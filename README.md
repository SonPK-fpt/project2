## Description of the project

Your company's human resources department wishes to build an application that employees can use internally. To improve collaboration and transparency within the company, every employee can access the app and create a poll with two proposed solutions.
Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solution has the most votes. Additionally, HR has asked to have a dashboard that lists every employee sorted by the number of polls they've created and responded to.
To encourage employees to use app, HR will award prizes each quarter to the top employees who create and respond to the most polls.

In the "Employee Polls" Project, you will build a web application that allows employees to create polls for co-workers. The process goes like this: The employee is asked a question of the form: “Do you prefer [choice A] or [choice B]?”. Can't answer "no" or "both".

In your app, users will be able to answer polls, see which polls they haven't answered, see how others voted, post polls, and see user rankings on the rankings.
